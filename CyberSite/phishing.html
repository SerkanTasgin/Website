<h3>The Most Popular Type of Cybercrime</h3>
<p>Among all different kinds of cyberattacks, phishing remains the biggest threat to individuals and businesses. Phishing is a type of online fraud that involves tricking people into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by masquerading as a trustworthy source.

    In our increasingly technological world, phishing attacks are evolving at a quicker pace than many of us seem to realise. The days of deploying a large mass of generic and fraudulent emails onto endless recipients are often being replaced with newer tactics.
    
    According to <a class="aa" href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2021.pdf">APWGâ€™s Phishing Activity Trends Report</a> published in February 2022, phishing attacks hit an all-time high in 2021. With more than 300,000 attacks recorded in December, these incidents have become more than three times as common as they were less than two years ago.</p>

        <h3>Phishing Emails</h3>
        <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware.</p><br>
        <p>Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim is navigating the site, and transverse any additional security boundaries with the victim. As of 2020, phishing is by far the most common attack performed by cybercriminals, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Centre recording over twice as many incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crime.</p>

        <h3>User Training is Important</h3>
        <p>People can be trained to recognize phishing attempts, and to deal with them through a variety of approaches. Such education can be effective, especially where training emphasizes conceptual knowledge and provides direct feedback.</p><br>
        <p>Therefore, an essential part of any organization or institutions anti-phishing strategy is to actively educate its users so that they can identify phishing scams without hesitation and act accordingly. Although there is currently a lack of data and recorded history that shows educational guidance and other information-based interventions successfully reduce susceptibility to phishing, large amounts of information regarding the phishing threat are available on the Internet.</p>
