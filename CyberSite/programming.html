<p>Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, their own pros and cons, so the right programming language for you will vary depending on your specific skills and interests.

However, some languages are more commonly used in cybersecurity than others, so learning these programming languages can give you a head start in this field.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Python is a very good choice (rather an excellent choice) for cybersecurity enthusiasts, system administrators, and software developers. It is simple to learn and easy to apply in various projects.</p>

<p>Python can be used to create network scanners, web application scanners, exploits, brute force programs, etc.

Some important tools of cyber security you should know are Nmap, Metasploit framework, w3af, kismet wireless tool, and Wireshark NIDS.
    
All of them are written in python. Here I have tried to list some reasons why python is preferred by most cyber security professionals over other programming languages.</p>
<h4>Why is Python an ideal programming language for cybersecurity?</h4> 
<p>Python is a top choice of programming language in cyber security. To understand better how Python is used in cyber security, it is necessary to look into its various features.</p>   
<ul id="ulclass">
    <li>Python is easy to learn, and even new users can easily use it to code. The advanced features might take more time to learn. However, its basic features take only a few hours or days to learn.</li><br>
    <li>It is a free, open-source program that can be modified based on need. Once modified, it can be redistributed for free.</li><br>
    <li>You don’t need to create separate codes for each operating system. One code can be used on multiple operating systems.</li><br>
    <li>Its codes are not complicated but are easy to read and understand.</li><br>
    <li>You don’t need to create everything with Python. You only need to explore the library and make use of the tools and codes available.</li><br>
    <li>Python perfectly fits high-level programming due to its architecture.</li><br>
    <li>Being an open-source program, you can connect with an online community and learn more.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>While IT and security professionals have to deploy several tools and technologies to keep organisations safe, Python is one powerful device in this arsenal.  Apart from deploying Python, educational institutions must undertake other cybersecurity best practices like having a good cyber incident response plan and giving their IT staff high-quality cybersecurity training on a regular basis. With all such efforts combined, it is indeed possible for institutes of higher learning to avoid cyber-attacks or at least minimize their impact.</p>
