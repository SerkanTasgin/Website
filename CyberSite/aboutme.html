    <p>I was born in Germany but when I was 4 years old, my family turned back to Turkey.  Therefore, I grew up in Turkey. I have been living in Switzerland for 16 months.</p>
    <p>Having completed Bachelors Degree, I worked 17 years as a detective and security manager in different departments such as Cyber Crime and Homicide. Throughout my professional life course, I always looked for ways to improve myself. For example, I wanted to have an international working experience, so I worked for the United Nations in Liberia in West Africa. I have always been passionate about learning, therefore, I went to United States and finished Masters Degree in University of Louisville and got a PhD degree from Michigan State University.</p>
    <p>After getting my PhD degree, I came back to Turkey with good research and statistical analysis skills, and I wanted to use these skills at my job. Therefore, I created crime data and analyzed this data and then created prevention programs. Due to these research based programs, I have managed to reduce the crime rate in my city. I was also very productive in doing research and writing about it. I wrote almost 20 journal articles, books and book chapters and presented my research findings in international conferences in Boston, Washington DC and LA.</p>
    <p>As Iâ€™ve thought about my next steps, I decided to transition into IT field with learning Cybersecurity and Information Security Management trainings. I got Security+ and ISO 27001 Lead Auditor Certificates.</p>
    <p>So in a nutshell, that is who I am professionally and when I am not working, I like hiking and playing games with my family, playing guitar, and playing chess.</p>
